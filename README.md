This project is a web application designed to enhance the user experience of route planning by integrating Google Maps and real-time updates from users. It allows users to search for routes between a source and destination while adding waypoints for more detailed routing. The platform offers multiple route options, and upon selecting a route, users can view the current weather conditions for that route, helping them make informed travel decisions.

After selecting a route, users can log in or register to access additional features. Once logged in, users can upload route and weather images to share live updates about the selected route. These updates are displayed to other users, providing valuable insights into the current conditions of the routes. To maintain the accuracy and relevance of this information, only images uploaded within the last 12 hours are displayed.

The platform also includes a user-driven rating system, where users can rate the uploaded images based on their usefulness. These ratings contribute to the uploader's credit score, creating a community-driven environment where contributors are recognized for providing helpful updates. This time-sensitive and interactive approach makes the application an essential tool for travelers seeking accurate and up-to-date route information.
